EMBEDDED FIRMWARE ESSENTIALS HW1

HOURS SPENT:  Spent around 4-5 hours setting up the environment on virtual machine
              Spent 3 hours reading about LPC17xx GPIO PORTS,Registers and configuration 
              Spent 2 hours understanding the assembly instructions in relation to the code
              
  GPIO Configuration 
  The pin allocated for me Pin 26 corresponds to Port 3[26] pin on the board. The GPIO configuration includes
  - configure the pin as a GPIO - configure PINSEL7 to function as GPIO
  - Set pin direction to Output - configure FIO3DIR -0x2009C060 by setting pin 26 of port 3 high
  - To toggle the voltage status of the pin 
  using FIOSET for port 3-FIO3SET                   FIO3SET | = 0X04000000
  and to clear the value using  FIO3CLR             FIO3CLR | = 0x04000000 
  
  Checked the same code on mbed.org and compiled into bin file.
  
 Working on the error on unidentified identifier for the uint32_t while compiling on arm-none-eabi-gcc.
